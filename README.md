This project is a template with some basic functionality for the ASW labs.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components, each in its own directory:

-   `webapp/`: A frontend application built with React, Vite, and TypeScript.
-   `users/`: A backend service for managing users, built with Node.js and Express.
-   `gamey/`: A Rust game engine and bot service.

Each component has its own `package.json` file with the necessary scripts to run and test the application.

## Basic Features

*   **User Registration**: The web application provides a simple form to register new users.
*   **User Service**: The user service receives the registration request, simulates some processing, and returns a welcome message.

## Components

### Webapp

The `webapp` is a single-page application (SPA) created with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/).

-   `src/App.tsx`: The main component of the application.
-   `src/RegisterForm.tsx`: The component that renders the user registration form.
-   `package.json`: Contains scripts to run, build, and test the webapp.
-   `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite.
-   `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the webapp.

### Users Service

The `users` service is a simple REST API built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

-   `users-service.js`: The main file for the user service. It defines an endpoint `/createuser` to handle user creation.
-   `package.json`: Contains scripts to start the service.
-   `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the user service.

### Gamey

The `gamey` component is a Rust-based game engine with bot support, built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

-   `src/main.rs`: Entry point for the application.
-   `src/lib.rs`: Library exports for the gamey engine.
-   `src/bot/`: Bot implementation and registry.
-   `src/core/`: Core game logic including actions, coordinates, game state, and player management.
-   `src/notation/`: Game notation support (YEN, YGN).
-   `src/web/`: Web interface components.
-   `Cargo.toml`: Project manifest with dependencies and metadata.
-   `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the gamey service.

## Running the Project

You can run this project using Docker (recommended) or locally without Docker.

### With Docker

This is the easiest way to get the project running. You need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

1.  **Build and run the containers:**
    From the root directory of the project, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This command will build the Docker images for both the `webapp` and `users` services and start them.

2.  **Access the application:**
    *   Web application: [http://localhost](http://localhost)
    *   User service API: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
    *   Gamey API: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

### Without Docker

To run the project without Docker, you will need to run each component in a separate terminal.

#### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.

#### 1. Running the User Service

1.  **Navigate to the `users` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd users
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the service:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The user service will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 2. Running the Web Application

1.  **Navigate to the `webapp` directory:**
    ```bash
    cd webapp
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The web application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Available Scripts

Each component has its own set of scripts defined in its `package.json`. Here are some of the most important ones:

### Webapp (`webapp/package.json`)

-   `npm run dev`: Starts the development server for the webapp.
-   `npm test`: Runs the unit tests.
-   `npm run test:e2e`: Runs the end-to-end tests.
-   `npm run start:all`: A convenience script to start both the `webapp` and the `users` service concurrently.

### Users (`users/package.json`)

-   `npm start`: Starts the user service.
-   `npm test`: Runs the tests for the service.

### Gamey (`gamey/Cargo.toml`)

-   `cargo build`: Builds the gamey application.
-   `cargo test`: Runs the unit tests.
-   `cargo run`: Runs the gamey application.
